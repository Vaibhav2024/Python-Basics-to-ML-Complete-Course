Satellites are placed from the surface to the orbit by launch vehicles, high enough to avoid orbital decay
by the atmosphere. Satellites can then change or maintain the orbit by propulsion, usually by chemical or
ion thrusters. As of 2018, about 90% of the satellites orbiting the Earth are in low Earth orbit or
geostationary orbit; geostationary means the satellites stay still in the sky (relative to a fixed point
