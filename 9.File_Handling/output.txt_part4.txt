the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Because satellites can see a large portion of the Earth at once,
communications satellites can relay information to remote places. The signal delay from satellites and 
their orbit's predictability are used in satellite navigation systems, such as GPS. Space probes are 
satellites designed for robotic space exploration outside of Earth, and space stations are in essence
