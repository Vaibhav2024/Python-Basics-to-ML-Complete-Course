Satellites are placed from the surface to the orbit by launch vehicles, high enough to avoid orbital decay
by the atmosphere. Satellites can then change or maintain the orbit by propulsion, usually by chemical or
ion thrusters. As of 2018, about 90% of the satellites orbiting the Earth are in low Earth orbit or
geostationary orbit; geostationary means the satellites stay still in the sky (relative to a fixed point
on the ground). Some imaging satellites chose a Sun-synchronous orbit because they can scan the entire
globe with similar lighting. As the number of satellites and space debris around Earth increases, the
threat of collision has become more severe. A small number of satellites orbit other bodies (such as
the Moon, Mars, and the Sun) or many bodies at once (two for a halo orbit, three for a Lissajous
orbit).

Earth observation satellites gather information for reconnaissance, mapping, monitoring the weather, ocean,
forest, etc. Space telescopes take advantage of outer space's near perfect vacuum to observe objects with
the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Because satellites can see a large portion of the Earth at once,
communications satellites can relay information to remote places. The signal delay from satellites and 
their orbit's predictability are used in satellite navigation systems, such as GPS. Space probes are 
satellites designed for robotic space exploration outside of Earth, and space stations are in essence 
crewed satellites.
